//DATA STRUCTURES
//NOTE: A "Data Structure" defines the physical form of the data type
//NOTE: Data structures can be directly implemented on hardware
//NOTE: Data structures uses "RAM Memory Blocks" and "RAM Memory Addresses" to implement
//NOTE: Data structures serve as the basis for "Abstract Data Types (ADT)"

//Primitive Data Structures
//1. Boolean //2. Character //3. Floating-Point Number //4. Fixed-Point Number //5. Integer //6. Pointer //7. Enumerated Type

//EXAMPLE 1: A "Floating-Point Number" can be represented in "IEEE binary 64 Floating-Point Number" physical implementation
//EXAMPLE 2: An "Integer" can be represented in "Two's Complement" physical implementation

//Composite Data Structures
//NOTE: "Composite Data Structures" can be built using "Primitive Data Structures" and other "Composite Data Structures"
//1. Array //2. Linked List

//EXAMPLE: An "Integer Array" can be built using any "Integer Data Structure" and with any "Pointer Data Structure"

//ABSTRACT DATA TYPES
//NOTE: An Abstract Data Type uses at least one Data Structure at its core
//NOTE: Abstract Data Types are direct or indirect representations of their hardware counterpart

//Primitive Abstract Data Types
//1. boolean //2. char //3. float //4. int

//EXAMPLE 1: An "int" can use anything from an "Integer Data Structure" to a "Floating-Point Number Data Structure" to represent its values
//EXAMPLE 2: A "boolean" can use an "Integer Data Structure" to represent its values, but shows the programmer "true" and "false"

//Composite Abstract Data Types
//1. Array //2. List //3. Set //4. Queue //5. Map //6. Tree //7. Graph

//EXAMPLE: The "Array Composite Abstract Data Type" is often implemented using "Array Composite Data Structure"
