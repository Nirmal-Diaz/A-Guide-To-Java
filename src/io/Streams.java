//THE UTF-8
//NOTE: UTF-8 is one of many methods to encode "Unicode" code points, with others being UTF-16, UTF-32 etc.
//NOTE: UTF-8 uses 1-4 8bit(1 byte) binary sequences to represent characters
//NOTE: therefore some UTF-8 encoded characters can have variable number of bytes ranging from 1byte to 4bytes

//Encoding to UTF-8
//Example: â‚¬
//1. Get the code point using the unicode table -> U+20AC
//2. Following should be obtained using the code point
//The "number of bytes" needed to encode the given character -> 3 (Should be determined using table)
//The "binary value" -> 20AC -> 0010 0000 1010 1100
//3. Construct the 1st byte
//Add the required "number of bytes" as binary 1's in the first 4bits
//1110 **** **** **** **** ****
//The first 4bits of the "binary value" is added next
//1110 0010 **** **** **** ****
//4. Construct the 2nd byte
//Next six bits of the "binary value" is added to the last 6 bits of the 2nd byte
//1110 0010 **00 0010 **** ****
//Pattern "10" is added to mark 2nd byte as a "continuation byte"
//1110 0010 1000 0010 **** ****
//4. Construct the 3rd byte
//Next six bits of the binary value is added to the last 6 bits of the 3nd byte
//1110 0010 1000 0010 **10 1100
//Pattern "10" is added to mark 3nd byte as a "continuation byte"
//1110 0010 1000 0010 1010 1100
//5. Represent final result in different number systems
//11100010 10000010 10101100 = 226 130 172 = E2 82 AC

//TRY-WITH-RESOURCE STATEMENT
//NOTE: When working with resources, we have to close (With the "close()") all the used resources when they are no longer needed
//NOTE: Java provides a special code structure called "try-with-resource statement" for the purpose of automatically closing resources
//NOTE: The "try-with-resource statement" only works with classes that implement "AutoClosable"
//NOTE: All the classes used below implements "AutoCloseable", therefore we can initialize them with a "try-with-resource" statement
